# 🚀 Predictive Maintenance API

This project is a production-ready FastAPI microservice that predicts machine failure using sensor input data. It demonstrates best practices in AI Engineering, including model deployment, real-time inference, and CI/CD setup.

---

## 🧠 Use Case: Predictive Maintenance

Predict whether a machine will fail soon based on:
- Temperature
- Vibration
- Pressure
- Runtime hours

Built for industrial settings like manufacturing or energy sectors to reduce downtime and optimize maintenance schedules.
